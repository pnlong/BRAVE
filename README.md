This repo contains the official Pytorch implementaiton of **BRAVE** a low-latency audio variational autoencoder for instrumental performance. It also implements all of the [other models tested on the paper](https://github.com/fcaspe/BRAVE/tree/main/configs).

Check the [`evaluation`](https://github.com/fcaspe/BRAVE/tree/main/evaluation) directory for info on replicating the results of the paper.


## Install

We use the **acids-rave** package for preprocessing the audio datasets and training the models.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fcaspe/BRAVE
cd BRAVE
```

### Option A: Conda env from `environment.yaml` (recommended)

The repo ships [`environment.yaml`](./environment.yaml) with Python 3.11, **ffmpeg** (conda-forge), and **`pip`** deps `h5py` and **`acids-rave==2.3`**.

With **conda** (or **mamba**/ **micromamba**—same `-f` flow):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate brave
```

To refresh an existing env after the file changes: `conda env update -n brave -f environment.yaml --prune`.

### Option B: Manual install

```bash
pip install h5py acids-rave==2.3 # may work with lower versions too.
conda install ffmpeg
```

## Preparing Dataset

We use the same `rave preprocess` tool as RAVE for dataset preparation. Also, RAVE datasets will work with this repo's models. [Check RAVE's info on dataset preparation](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE?tab=readme-ov-file#dataset-preparation).

```bash
rave preprocess --input_path /audio/folder --output_path path/to/preprocessed/dataset/ --channels X
```

## Training

We use the same `rave train` CLI for training. Make sure to specify with `--config` a path to one of the `.gin` configs provided in this repo. For instance, to train BRAVE:

```bash
rave train --config ./configs/brave.gin --name my_brave_run --db_path path/to/preprocessed/dataset/
```

## Exporting BRAVE for Real-Time Inference

### Low-latency BRAVE Plugin

The [Minifusion plugin](https://minifusion.live) can run BRAVE models at < 10 ms latency and low jitter (~3 ms).

Use the `export_brave_plugin.py` utility to export a trained model. This requires a BRAVE checkpoint (`.ckpt`) created with `rave train`.  
It does not work with models exported to TorchScript (`.ts`).

```bash
python ./scripts/export_brave_plgin.py --model path/to/model_checkpoint.ckpt --output_path ./exported_model.h5
```
**NOTE:** BRAVE works better when run at its original sampling rate. For best results, make sure that you run the plugin **at the same sample rate as the data used to train it**.

### Standard RAVE Export Method

BRAVE is compatible with many creative coding tools and plugins that use RAVE models. You can export a BRAVE model to work with some great tools created by the community, such as:

 - [nn~](https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde) for Max-MSP & PureData
 - [SuperCollider](https://github.com/victor-shepardson/rave-supercollider) UGen
 - IRCAM's [RAVE VST](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/rave-vst/)
 - And probably some more

Please note these might show **higher latency** than the BRAVE Plugin due to a different audio buffering strategy.
 ```bash
rave export --run path/to/model_checkpoint.ckpt
```
This will store a TorchScript `(.ts)` model next to the checkpoint file which you can load on your selected application.
